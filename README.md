#### Monthly Water Purchasing Calculator(Squarelator)
This Calculator is my first ever practice project of javascript..
##### Information
I am excited to introduce my new web application designed to make tracking your daily liquid purchases a breeze. With our app, you can easily keep track of the quantity of liquids you buy each day, and at the end of the month, our calculator will automatically calculate your total quantity and price.

Whether you're buying water, milk, or any other type of liquid in liters, our app makes it easy to add your daily purchases. Simply input the quantity of liquid you purchase each day, and my app will take care of the rest. At the end of the month, all you need to do is input the price per liter, and my app will calculate your total quantity and price.

My web application is perfect for anyone who wants to stay on top of their liquid purchases and make sure they are getting the best value for their money. Whether you're a busy professional, a student, or a busy parent, my app will help you save time and money.
